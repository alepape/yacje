# Yet Another Collaborative JSON-schema Editor

I've been looking for a way to collaborate on the design of JSON schemas but couldn't find one. JSON.link was good but missed a few features, and is blocked at work...
...So I "created" one - rather, I glued a few fantastic tools into a single UI.

- CodeMirror
- Firepad / Firebase
- HJSON
- JSON Schema Faker

If you're into Docker, head to https://hub.docker.com/r/alexlepape/yacje to get a basic image.
